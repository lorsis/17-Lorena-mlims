                        <h4>Origin</h4>
                        <p>Oranges and tangerines are two varieties of citrus, their origin comes from Asia, were
                                introduced into the Iberian Peninsula by the Arabs in the 10th century, was a bitter
                                modality, in the
                                XV came from the hands of the Portuguese new varieties with a much sweeter and flavorful
                                taste:
                                citrus sinensis (orange) and citrus reticulata (orange tangerine). Interestingly, that’s
                                where the name comes from
                                of 'oranges of China', since its origin was precisely the ancient Asian country.</p>
                        <h4>Where to find them</h4>
                        <p>The Valencian Community is the main citrus region at national level, both for the area
                                dedicated to this crop as by production. In the Marina Alta predominates above all in
                                the northern area
                                in municipalities such as: <b>Dénia, Els Poblets, El Verger, Beniarbeig, Ondara, Pego,
                                        Pedreguer
                                        and the so-called peoples of Retoria.</b></p>
                        <h4>Experiencias</h4>
                        <p><b>Flowering period:</b> It is in spring when the orange tree is covered with orange blossoms
                                that impregnate the
                                landscape with a pleasant aroma. Most of the flowers fall to the ground when opened,
                                forming a mantle
                                white around the tree. The other flowers, which have been pollinated, turn into oranges,
                                through the so-called curdled fruit which is the passage from flower to fruit, although
                                we will have to wait a few
                                months before they reach our table. The maturation phase extends from July to
                                February. During this period the growth and fattening of most varieties of
                                oranges.</p>
                        <p><b>Harvesting period:</b> The orange season lasts practically nine months of the year. This
                                does not mean that a tree is giving oranges all this time, there are different varieties
                                of oranges, and each of them has its own months of collection. In this way we find
                                oranges from October or November to the end of June or July. These dates are not
                                accurate nor
                                constant weather, and specifically rainfall and temperature (and to a lesser extent
                                wind)
                                have much to say in this regard, as well as where the plantation is located. So
                                both, the beginning or end of the season of oranges can vary depending on the
                                peculiarities
                                that occur each year in particular.</p>
