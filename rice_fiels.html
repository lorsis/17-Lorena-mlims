                        <h4>Origen</h4>
                        <p>Rice cultivation began 7,000 years ago in Southeast Asia, then developed in
                                different countries. It was the Arabs who introduced it into the Iberian Peninsula after
                                the conquest, and
                                was subsequently implanted in all continents as a consequence of the large
                                discoveries led by the European conquerors. It is in the mid-nineteenth century that
                                reaches the Marina Alta and introduced its cultivation in the marsh located in Pego,
                                during that time the
                                municipality came to have seven producing mills. The rice paddy lasted until 1970, when
                                it was abandoned
                                for its low economic performance. Then proceeded to the transformation of the terrain
                                promoted
                                by the IRYDA and new crops were introduced. It was in 1995, when the Pego-Oliva Marsh
                                was declared
                                Natural Park, thus initiating a process of conservation and protection of this space,
                                from the
                                rice production. It should be noted that the balance between traditional cultivation and
                                respect for the environment have been responsible for the survival of many species
                                plants and animals of high ecological value.</p>
                        <h4>Where to find it</h4>
                        <p> The marsh of <b>Pego-Oliva</b>, whose municipality concentrates about 5000 flooded rice
                                fields,
                                although it is also shared with the municipality of Denia, to which 2300 hanegadas
                                belong.</p>
                        <h4>Experiences</h4>
                        <p><b>Flowering period:</b> Between late July and early August, it is during this last month
                                when it goes
                                making the grain. During these two summer months the spectacular landscape is covered
                                with an attractive
                                green mantle full of ears.
                                <b>Period of mowing:</b> During the first half of September the mowing occurs. The straw
                                is separated from the
                                grain and it dries in the sun. The mowing is mechanical.
